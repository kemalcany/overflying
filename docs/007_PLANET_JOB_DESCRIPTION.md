- Type safety throughout (TypeScript + Pydantic)

**DevOps & Infrastructure**
- Kubernetes deployment on GKE
- CI/CD pipeline with staging/production environments
- Custom domain setup with SSL/TLS
- Infrastructure as code

**Customer-Focused Features**
- Job management (CRUD operations)
- Real-time telemetry (planned)
- Usage reporting (Go service planned)
- Intuitive UI with accessibility in mind

**Documentation**
- Comprehensive guides for setup, development, deployment
- OpenAPI specification for API
- Architecture documentation
- Inline code comments

## Key Differentiators

- Map visualization with deck.gl
- Satellite tile processing simulation

See: [Roadmap - Milestone 4](006_ROADMAP.md#milestone-4-spatial-features-planet-specific)

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture

**Planet mentions**: "Writing backend APIs or event-driven data pipelines"

**Constellation implements**:
- NATS for event streaming
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- Worker architecture for background processing
- Async patterns throughout

See: [Architecture](003_ARCHITECTURE.md#events--real-time)

### 4. Customer Telemetry

**Planet requirement**: "Customer telemetry integration"

**Constellation plans**:
- Go service for usage aggregation
- Account-level reporting
- Usage leaderboards
- Time-series metrics

See: [Roadmap - Milestone 5](006_ROADMAP.md#milestone-5-multi-tenancy--go-service)

### 5. Production-Grade Practices

- Comprehensive testing (unit + integration + E2E)
- CI/CD with staging/production environments
- Kubernetes deployment
- Observability planning (OpenTelemetry)
- Security best practices (secrets management, HTTPS)

## Team Fit

### Collaborative Mindset
- Documented architecture decisions
- Clear communication in documentation
- Openness to feedback and iteration

### Customer Requirements First
- Focused on user experience
- Thoughtful error handling
- Accessible UI components (Radix UI)

### Adaptable & Learning
